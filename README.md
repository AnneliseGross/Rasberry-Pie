# Raspberry-Pie

My partner and I don't have any code for the Raspberry Pi because of the technology problems we encountered when working on this project. 

Something that (hopefully) worked was the clone of the python repo. It was very difficult at first, but luckily I got help from a friend in to help me make a copy of my document onto the Raspberry Pi!

Something that didn't go as planned was the frequent technological breakdowns of our Raspberry Pie, but we kept trying with each new replacement, and we at least had fun figuring out how to work the device!

Unfortunately, we ran out of time to do one of the projects on the Raspberry Pie, but I really wanted the little light board to either flash a secret message in morse code (like maybe the text of the opening paragraph in A New Hope), or flash different letters, emojis, or symbols.

I have learned so much this year, and I can't wait to go further indepth with coding at my new school next year!
