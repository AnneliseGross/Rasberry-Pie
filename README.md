## Raspberry-Pie

#My partner and I don't have any code for the Raspberry Pi because of the technology problems we encountered when working on this project. 

#Something that (hopefully) worked was the clone of the python repo. It was very difficult at first, but luckily I got help from a friend in to help me make a copy of my document onto the Raspberry Pi!
